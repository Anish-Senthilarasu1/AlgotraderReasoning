# AlgotraderReasoning
My First ever Algorithmic Trading Bot in Python utilizing Deepseek R1 Distilled for sentiment analysis, and utilizes the Alpaca API as a broker, alongside YFinance for historical data, Polygon for news collection, Pandas_TA For Technical Analysis.

Still an introductory project, it uses basic Technical Analysis along the lines of MACD and RSI_7, and still has flaws regarding stop losses and cap for orders, but hopes to use this as a prototype for more advanced quantitative models, and to further on the development and utilization of Reasoning Models for Sentiment Analaysis
