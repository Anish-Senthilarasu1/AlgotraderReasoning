# AlgotraderReasoning
My First ever Algorithmic Trading Bot in Python utilizing Deepseek R1 Distilled for sentiment analysis, and utilizes the Alpaca API as a broker, alongside YFinance for historical data, Polygon for news collection, Pandas_TA For Technical Analysis.

Still an introductory project, it uses basic Technical Analysis along the lines of MACD and RSI_7, and still has flaws regarding stop losses and cap for orders, but hopes to use this as a prototype for more advanced quantitative models, and to further on the development and utilization of Reasoning Models for Sentiment Analysis
Cherry Picked Result, but after one day of trading and letting it sit for one week, we were fortunate enough to see a 10 percent ROI.
